2. SCALABILITY ANALYSIS:
   - All algorithms handle up to 200 users effectively
   - Load balancing improves with higher user densities
   - Auction-based algorithm excels in crowded scenarios

3. ENERGY EFFICIENCY:
   - Energy consumption varies significantly based on load
   - Nash Equilibrium optimizes energy usage effectively
   - Distance-based positioning impacts energy consumption

4. USER SATISFACTION:
   - User satisfaction decreases with network congestion
   - Ground station integration improves service quality
   - Satisfaction correlates with load balancing efficiency

CONCLUSIONS:
---------------
1. Cooperative Game Theory shows best overall performance
